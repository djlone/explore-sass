_s
===

Hi. This is a starter theme called `_s`, or `underscores`, if you like. I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.

* Smartly organized starter CSS in `style.css` that will help you to quickly get your design off the ground.
* Licensed under GPLv2 or later. :) Use it to make something cool.

## Instructions


1. Make sure you have these installed

- [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

- [Grunt.JS](http://https://gruntjs.com/)
- [SASS](http://http://sass-lang.com/)
- [AutoPrefixer] (https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
  


Good luck!
